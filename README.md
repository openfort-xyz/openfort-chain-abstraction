# Openfort Ecosystem abstraction

## Overview
Ecosystems serve as parent entities for groups of apps operating across different blockchains. Openfort [**ecosystem wallets**](https://www.openfort.xyz/docs/guides/ecosystem) enable seamless interoperability between applications, allowing ecosystems to design their ideal, unified wallet experience. The next evolution is consolidating user liquidity across apps, providing a single, unified dollar balance instantly spendable across the ecosystem. This vision will be powered by Openfort's advanced chain abstraction implementation based on [MagicSpend++](https://ethresear.ch/t/magicspend-spend-now-debit-later/19678/9) hosted in this repository.

You will find *at least* the following contracts:
* time-locked Vault and related interfaces
* Chain Abstraction Paymaster and related interfaces

Any additional contracts will be added to the repository as needed...

## Ecosystem Chain Abstraction Settings: accessible from Openfort Dashboard

#### Vault
- Locking period
- ERC20 ticker? (depends if we decide that vault shares are ERC20)
- Supported chains
- Supported assets (each asset must have a correspondence in dollars)

#### Auto-fund amount
Ecosystems can choose to pre-fund their usersâ€™ accounts to reduce friction.
=> if it doesn't then user *MUST*  lock funds before activating chain abstraction ðŸš©

_Note:_ This "locking" can be simplified into a **SEND** transaction from an EOA to an AA. A backend watcher service could listen for `received` events and automatically lock the funds (i.e., transfer them to the time-locked vault). This approach would require users to sign a session key for the watcher service.

**Q:** Should the ecosystem remain the owner of the funds?

#### Paymaster
* Set/update the Paymaster owner address (the owner private key _MUST_ be owned by the ecosystem).
* Fund/withdraw Paymaster balance (Openfort crafts the transaction, but the ecosystem owner _MUST_ sign it).
* Set a webhook to receive alerts when the Paymaster balance falls below a certain threshold.
	The Paymaster fronts the funds on the destination chain for the user if they _HAVE_ enough locked balance (checked by the Paymaster Service). The Paymaster contract will then be reimbursed on the source chain(s). Ni1o: user has 100@A, 50@B, and spends 130@C

Trust Assumption:
* ATM, user *MUST* trust owner of `verifyingSigner` address to call `repay` from `InvoiceManager` only after the Paymaster fronted the funds. ðŸš© ðŸš© ðŸš© 
    Possible solution: write invoice on a setllement contract from Paymaster `_postOp` on `opSucceeded` and leverage socket DL to call the invoice manager on the source chain and get reimbursed.
* Ecosystems *MUST* trust Openfort's Paymaster Service to verify user-locked balances and append its special signature to the `paymasterAndData` userOperation field.


### Chain Abstraction Activation process

*for each* blockchain supported by the ecosystem:
* Deploy one time-locked Vault implementation per supported ERC20:
   Here is some inspiration:
    
    | [ERC-4626 Tokenize-Vaults](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4626)
    | [ERC-7575 Multi-Asset vaults](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7575)
    | [example of Time-locked vault implementation](https://github.com/superical/time-lock-vault/tree/main)
* Deploy a custom ERC20 with ecosystem ticker representing the vaults' common "shares"
* Deploy the Chain Abstraction Paymaster


Bonus:
* The locked balance can technically generate a yield for users. Ethereum offers numerous DeFi primitives with instant liquidity access. Openfort and ecosystems could leverage this argument to incentivize users to lock funds.
